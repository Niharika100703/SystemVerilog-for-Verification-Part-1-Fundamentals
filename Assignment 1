Assume System Consist of two global signals resetn and clk. Use an initial block to initialize clk to 1'b0 and resetn to 1'b0.

User must keep resetn in an active low state for 60 nSec at the start of the simulation and then make active high. Assume `timescale 1ns/1ps



`timescale 1ns/1ps

module tb;
  reg rst;
  reg clk;
  
  initial begin
    rst = 1'b0;
    clk = 1'b0;
    #60;
    rst = 1'b1;
  end
  
  // Clock generation  - without clk generation, we cant change reset
  initial begin
    forever #5 clk = ~clk; // Toggle clock every 5 ns for a 10 ns period (100 MHz clock)
  end

  initial begin
    $dumpfile("dump.vcd");
    $dumpvars;
  end
  
endmodule

  
endmodule
