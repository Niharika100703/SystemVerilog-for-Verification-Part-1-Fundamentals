////Create an array capable of storing 10 elements of an unsigned integer. 
Initialize all the 10 elements to a value equal to the square of the index of that element. 
for e.g. first element has index no. 0 so initialize it to 0, the second element has index no. 1 so initialize it to 1, 
the third element has index no. 2 so initialize it to 4, and so on. 
Verify the code by sending values of all the elements on Console.

module tb;
  
  bit arr[10] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; //as it is unsigned integer, we can use bit datatype
  
  initial begin
    
    for(int i =0; i<10; i++) /// unlike C/C++ we cant use {}, we must use begin and end
      
    begin
      $display("the square of index %0d is: ", i, i*i );
      end
    
  end
      
endmodule
